> **Note:** Reynard is my personal LibreWolf configuration, shared publicly in case it's useful to others. Consider this a beta/work-in-progress, configurations, preference, settings are tested on my hardware & operating system, but may need adjustments for yours.

Reynard transforms LibreWolf into a faster, more comfortable browser without major sacrifices in privacy. Designed for advanced users who understand browser internals and are comfortable with occasional breakage.
